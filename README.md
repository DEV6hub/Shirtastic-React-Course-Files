# Welcome to ShirtTasticâœ¨ðŸ‘•âœ¨

We're a growing startup that believes we can be your one stop shop for shirt customization and ordering!

Now that we secured some seed money, we were able to hire a developer to get our site up and running.

The problem is that orders are really hit and miss. So we polled our user base and what we found is that our site isn't as great as we thought it was.

Essentially, customers are having a time viewing our prducts and placing orders. Feel free to view the app and have a look for yourself!

## Installation

- Download the application `git clone https://github.com/mtliendo/Shirtastic-React-Course-Files.git`
- Change into the project `cd Shirtastic-React-Course-Files`
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the application `npm run start`
- In another terminal, start the backend server (view the `package.json` for the correct script)

---

Once the application is running, and before looking into the code, take a moment to click around and see how the app works, feels, what routes are available, etc.

After feeling like you've got a good sense of how the app is supposed to behave, you can open the site in your [favorite code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Now that you see the code, try to map the code, to what you saw on the webpage. My recommendation is to also open up your react and redux devtools so that you can see what global state is available and where components live.

## Helping out with Fixes

Word on the street is that you're a rockstar developer and can help fix some of these bugs! I went ahead and created a [project sheet](https://github.com/mtliendo/Shirtastic-React-Course-Files/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen) so that you can easily see what's needing to get done. Go ahead and check that out and feel free to message me if anything needs cleared up!

You only got one chance to get my business back on track so give it all you got...or you're fired! It's like the saying goes:

> If a first you don't succeed...skydiving isn't for you!
