NAVBAR
selecting the hamburger and the icon don't do anything.
Logo in the navbar bleeds out of the navbar itself

LOGIN PAGE (Home page)

When signing up,
I get a password message saying:
 it should contain numbers,
 it should contain special characters
 Looks good
all at once.  As the user types, these should be checked onChange

/catalog Page
After signing in, "FETCHING SHIRTS" remains displayed at the top
There is not way to logout...no way to get back to the login screen
There is no indicator of who is logged in. The username should be tracked

When clicking the cart, then clicking "Go to shopping"
 A shipping info slider shows up. 
  The user is not able to enter their name
  The user is abl to submit the form when no values are entered

When creating a shirt and adding it to the cart, the price is static at 61.94. This should instead be the calculated based on the price of the shirts.

Application should be codesplit so that if a user does not login, they do not load the entire site. 

Proptypes are not added, so it is unclear what data types are flowing in the application

Mixed strategies: Some functions are bound by being an arrow functions, others are explicitly bound with .bind() Refactor to only use arrow functions
